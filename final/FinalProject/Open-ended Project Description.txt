Open-ended Project
A simple game using custom-made console-written GUI animations.

A simple fight between a duck and a hunter. The user can choose to attack or defend. On attack, an animation will run in the console. 
The animation will be designed using a system of arrays and methods, console-width, and rewriting the console at a set rate of FPS.

Character abs:(health, attack, name)
  ^Duck
  ^Hunter
Screen (screen<arrays>, Rewrite())
DuckScreen (Write the duck to screen<array> in different poses with multiple methods using global coordinate variables)
HunterScreen (similar)
BulletScreen (similar, will also track bullet using column++ in a while loop)
Game (run game logic and menu)

What I've worked on so far:
Game logic is sound. I discovered .readkey instead of .readline for quicker iteration with AI. Final screen animation reflects what I hope to accomplish with the bullet, duck, and hunter rewrites using the empty remaining classes.
